											<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Supporting a shelter means supporting a community. Even a small amount of donated time can help to improve the quality of life for the shelter’s four-legged residents. These things matter, because they make an impact on a greater scale by decreasing shelter overpopulation and helping to erase the practice of inhuman overbreeding exercised by puppy mills. </p>
								<p>It is our mission to connect dog-lovers everywhere to shelters in need of volunteers who can provide some love-filled belly rubs to our dogs, and support in contributing supplies, or simply by joining our mission and spreading awareness. Not only do we connect shelters and potential volunteers, but we also pride ourselves on filling in the gaps and providing awareness on how people can help both shelters and the dogs waiting for their forever home.</p>

												<h3>Things To Consider </h3>
												<p>Adopting</p>
											</header>
											<ul>
												<li>You are saving a life - The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically</li>
												<li>Less expensive than buying from a store or a breeder - The cost of spay/neuter and first vaccinations is included in the adoption price</li>
												<li>It’s one way to fight puppy mills - Puppy mills are factory-style breeding facilities that put profit above the welfare of dogs</li>
												<li>Helps more than just one animal - The cost of your adoption goes directly back into the shelter to help other dogs in need
													</li>
											  </ul>  
			
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<p>Fostering</p>
											</header>
											<ul>
												<li>Increases a dog’s chance of getting adopted - Give them a change to be healthy and happy so potential adopters get to see their real personality
												</li>
												<li>Keeps dogs out of shelters - Every time a shelter animal is able to leave the shelter for a foster home, space is created for another homeless dog</li>
											  <li>See if you’re ready for your own pet - You’ll gain experience caring for a pet, which is a great way to test the waters</li>
											<li>Flexibility - You can foster a dog for a couple of days at a time</li>
											<li>Temporary - The situation is not permanent if the foster dog is not a match for your life</li>
											</ul>
